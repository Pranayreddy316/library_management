ðŸ“Œ tbl_publisher â€“ Maintains publisher details such as name, address, and phone number.
ðŸ“Œ tbl_library_branch â€“ Represents different library branches and their locations.
ðŸ“Œ tbl_book_copies â€“ Tracks the number of copies of each book available at different branches.
ðŸ“Œ tbl_borrower â€“ Stores information about library members (borrowers).
ðŸ“Œ tbl_book_loans â€“ Records book borrow transactions, including due dates.
